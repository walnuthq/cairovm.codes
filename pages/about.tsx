        <p className="pb-6">
          During a smart contract execution, memory can be accessed with
          opcodes. When an offset is first accessed (either read or write),
          memory may trigger an expansion, which costs gas.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-6">
          Memory expansion may be triggered when the byte offset (modulo 32)
          accessed is bigger than previous offsets. If a larger offset trigger
          of memory expansion occurs, the cost of accessing the higher offset is
          computed and removed from the total gas available at the current call
          context.
        </p>

        <p className="pb-4">
          <p className="pb-4">
            The total cost for a given memory size is computed as follows:
          </p>
          <Pre>
            <code>
              memory_size_word = (memory_byte_size + 31) / 32
              <br />
              memory_cost = (memory_size_word ** 2) / 512 + (3 *
              memory_size_word)
            </code>
          </Pre>
        </p>

        <p className="pb-4">
          <p className="pb-4">
            When a memory expansion is triggered, only the additional bytes of
            memory must be paid for. Therefore, the cost of memory expansion for
            specific opcode is thus:
          </p>
          <Pre>
            <code>

          The <code>memory_byte_size</code> can be obtained with opcode{' '}
          <RelativeLink to="#59" title="MSIZE" />. The cost of memory expansion
          triggered by <RelativeLink to="#59" title="MSIZE" /> grows
          quadratically, disincentivizing the overuse of memory by making higher
          offsets more costly. Any opcode that accesses memory may trigger an

          ). Use our <RelativeLink title="reference" /> to review which opcode
          is capable of accessing memory. Note that opcodes with a byte size
          parameter of 0 will not trigger memory expansion, regardless of their

          External transactions are sent to the Ethereum network. Internal
          transactions are triggered by external transactions that have executed
          the xCALL instruction. As such, internal transactions are also known
          as calls. Access sets can be thought of as two independent types of
          lists: those of touched addresses, and those of touched contract
          storage slots.

        <p className="pb-6">
          When an address is accessed by a transaction, instruction, or used as

          <RelativeLink to="#31" title="BALANCE" />, on an address not present

        <p className="pb-6">
          Touch slot lists are a set of storage slot keys accessed by contract
          addresses. Slot lists are initialized to empty. When an opcode

          Opcodes that can modify the touched slot list are{' '}

          If an address or storage slot is present in the set, it is called
          'warm'; otherwise it is 'cold'. Storage slots that are touched for the
          first time in a transaction change from cold to warm for the duration
          of the transaction. Transactions can pre-specify contracts as warm
          using EIP-2930 access lists. The dynamic cost of some opcodes depend

          Some opcodes can trigger gas refunds, which reduces the gas cost of a
          transaction. Gas refunds are applied at the end of a transaction. If a
          transaction has insufficient gas to reach the end of its run, its gas
          refund cannot not be triggered, and the transaction fails. With the
          introduction of the <b>London</b> hardfork, two aspects of gas refunds
          changed. First, the limit to how much gas can be refunded is lowered
          from half of the total transaction cost, to one fifth of the total
          transaction cost. Second, the{' '}
          <RelativeLink to="#FF" title="SELFDESTRUCT" /> opcode cannot trigger
          gas refunds, only <RelativeLink to="#55" title="SSTORE" />.
